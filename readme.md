# Machine Learning Pipeline

The whole pipeline is prototyped in [```prototype.ipynb```](prototype.ipynb).

The updated version is split into multiple files. 
[```data_preparation.ipynb```](data_preparation.ipynb) contains code for data preparation from raw transactional data to a prepared csv file containing X and y for training. 
[```training.ipynb```](training.ipynb) runs the actual training process with different configurations.
[```feature_evaluation.ipynb```](feature_evaluation.ipynb) contains evaluation for the calculated metrics features.
